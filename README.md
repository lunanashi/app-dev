## Introduction

It's December! Can you believe it guys, [Christmas, just a week away!](https://www.tiktok.com/@canyoubelieveitguys_/video/7178264328578141482?lang=en)[^2] Despite it being only the 2nd of December, but who cares about such technicalities? In any case, we should move on to this month's anime revisit, perhaps one of my favourites during the past few years I've started rewatching anime![^3]
[^2]: Phrase only applicable during the 18th of December, but otherwise invalid.

We're talking, of course, about:
***Bocchi the Rock!***

## Short Synopsis

Hitori Gotou, “Bocchi-chan,” is a girl who’s so introverted and shy around people that she’d always start her conversations with “Ah...”

During her middle school years, she started playing the guitar, wanting to join a band because she thought it could be an opportunity for even someone shy like her to also shine. But because she had no friends, she ended up practicing guitar for six hours every day all by herself. After becoming a skilled guitar player, she uploaded videos of herself playing the guitar to the internet under the name “Guitar Hero” and fantasized about performing at her school’s cultural festival concert. But not only could she not find any bandmates, before she knew it, she was in high school and still wasn’t able to make a single friend!

She was really close to becoming a shut-in, but one day, Nijika Ijichi, the drummer in Kessoku Band, reached out to her. And because of that, her everyday life started to change little by little...

## Music

Being based around the titular character, as well as her band, Kessoku Band, it makes sense that *Bocchi the Rock!* has a plethora of songs featured. Here are a short list of the following:
